Claudio Monteverdi
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi (15 May 1567 (baptized) â€“ 29 November 1643), was an Italian composer, gambist, and singer.

Monteverdi's work, often regarded as revolutionary, marked the transition from the Renaissance style of music to that of the Baroque period.[1] He developed two individual styles of composition: the new basso continuo technique of the Baroque and the heritage of Renaissance polyphony.[2] Enjoying fame in his lifetime, he wrote one of the earliest operas, L'Orfeo, which is still regularly performed.
